      <p class="p-bg">I'm a passionate front-end developer specializing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on building responsive and engaging user interfaces. I enjoy crafting clean, functional designs and constantly work to improve my skills, including in languages like C, Java, and Python. Beyond coding, I'm an avid sketch artist and love expressing creativity through drawing and visual storytelling. I also enjoy playing the flute, solving strategic challenges in chess, and cycling â€” all of which help me stay balanced, inspired, and focused in both my personal and professional life. </p>
